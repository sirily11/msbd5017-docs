# Quest System in Sword Art Online

Like many RPG games, Sword Art Online features a comprehensive quest system where guild members can post quests and adventurers can complete them for rewards. Kayaba's implementation follows specific rules to ensure fairness and efficiency.

## Core Mechanics

The quest system allows players to both create and undertake quests, fostering a player-driven economy and community engagement.

## Quest Rules

1. **Posting Limitation**
- Each player may only have one active quest posted at any time

2. **Participation Restriction**
- Quest creators cannot participate in their own quests

3. **Completion Status**
- Each quest can only be completed once
- Only one player can accept a quest at a time

4. **Reward System**
- Successful completion grants the specified rewards to the completing player
- The quest creator must verify completion before rewards are distributed

## Quest Flow

1. Player posts a quest with defined rewards
2. Another player accepts the quest
3. Player completes the required tasks
4. Quest creator verifies completion
5. System distributes rewards to the completing player


## Events

In order to facilitate the quest system, the game uses a series of events to manage quest creation, acceptance, and completion.

`event QuestCreated(uint256 id, address indexed creator, Quest quest);`
- Emitted when a player creates a new quest

`event QuestTaken(uint256 id, address indexed taker, Quest quest);`
- Emitted when a player accepts a quest

`event QuestCompleted(uint256 id, address indexed completer, Quest quest);`
- Emitted when a player completes a quest

`event QuestVerified(
uint256 id,
address indexed verifier,
address indexed completer,
Quest quest
);`
- Emitted when a quest creator verifies completion

## Data Structures
Quests are represented using the following struct:

```solidity
 struct Quest {
      // Quest description
      string description;
      // Quest reward in wei
      uint reward;
      // Quest completion status
      bool completed;
      // Quest verification status
      bool verified;
      // Who take and will complete the quest
      address completer;
  }
```

## Functions

1. ` function createQuest(Quest memory quest) public payable`
 - Allows a player to create a new quest with the specified reward
2. `function takeQuest(uint questId) public`
 - Allows a player to accept a quest
3. `function completeQuest() public`
  - Allows a player to complete a quest
4. `function verifyComplete() public`
  - Allows a quest creator to verify quest completion. Since each player can only have one active quest, the system can easily determine the quest to verify.

> Why isn't there a "get all quests" function?
> In real-world applications, quests are typically too numerous to retrieve in a single function call. Best practice is to emit events that external indexers can monitor to maintain a database of quests. This approach:
> • Reduces blockchain storage costs
> • Improves query performance
> • Enables more flexible data filtering and sorting
