# Challenge 4 - Aincrad system design

> [!NOTE]
> In this challenge, we'll develop a suite of smart contracts that recreates the architectural system of Aincrad—the iconic floating castle from Sword Art Online.
> We'll guide you through implementing this virtual world's core mechanics using blockchain technology.
> Upon completion, you'll have access to the full code repository and comprehensive test suite.

In 2022, visionary programmer **Akihiko Kayaba** revolutionized virtual reality with the creation of **Aincrad**—a floating castle spanning 100 floors—powered by the groundbreaking **NerveGear** technology. This advancement marked the birth of true full-dive VR, bringing the world of **Sword Art Online** to life.

While the core game systems are operational and players can already explore this virtual world, several critical **MMORPG** features still await implementation. **Kayaba** now seeks an exceptional developer to complete these systems—and you've been selected for this exclusive opportunity.

As the chosen developer, you'll have access to shape Aincrad's architecture, receiving both `beta` testing access and a copy of the final game. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity... or is it?

> [!WARNING]
> This might be a game, but it's not something you play.
