# Install and connect wallet

In this chapter, we will guide you through the process of installing the necessary tools
and connecting your wallet to the network.

## Desktop wallet

Connecting your wallet to the Axiomesh Gemini network is a straightforward process. Simply click the button below to get started:

- If you don't have a wallet installed yet, you'll be guided to install one first
- If you already have a wallet, you'll be prompted to connect it
- Once connected, your wallet address will be displayed

The wallet connection process is secure and only requires a few clicks. Your wallet will serve as your identity on the network and allow you to interact with smart contracts and dApps.

# Mobile wallet

While desktop wallets excel at testing, debugging, and deploying smart contracts, mobile wallets offer superior security features. Mobile wallets store sensitive information in the device's secure enclave, ensuring private keys remain protected.

Modern mobile wallets now include convenient features like [passkey](https://www.passkeys.io/) authentication,

> [!tip]
> Both passkey authentication and blockchain use public-key cryptography - passkeys generate a private/public key pair where the private key is securely stored on your device while the public key is stored on servers, similar to how blockchain wallets use private keys to sign transactions and public keys/addresses for identification

eliminating the need to memorize mnemonic phrases. They also offer secure cloud backup options for wallet recovery. Most importantly, contemporary dApps are designed with mobile wallet compatibility in mind, allowing seamless integration whether you're accessing them from desktop or mobile devices.

Here are some of the mobile wallets that you can try and we may use it for attendance in the future ^ \_ ^:
